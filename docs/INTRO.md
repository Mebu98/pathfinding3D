# Pathfinding3D

## Introduction

Pathfinding algorithms for python3 froked from [python-pathfinding](https://github.com/brean/python-pathfinding) by [@brean](https://github.com/brean).

Currently there are 7 path-finders bundled in this library, namely:

- A*
- Dijkstra
- Best-First
- Bi-directional A*
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Iterative Deeping A\* (IDA*)
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MSP)

Dijkstra, A\* and Bi-directional A\* take the weight of the fields on the map into account.
